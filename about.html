      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a mechanical engineering student with a strong interest in automatic control,
        robotics and probabilistic machine learning. I enjoy working at the interface
        between physical systems, data and algorithms.
      </p>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <article class="project-card">
        <p class="project-summary">
          My background combines classical mechanical engineering with modern control and
          data-driven methods. Through my bachelor and master studies, I have worked on
          projects ranging from experimental mechanics and measurement setups to embedded
          control and probabilistic modelling.
        </p>
        <p class="project-summary">
          What motivates me is taking a real physical system – a robot, a flexible mast,
          a rotating shaft or a falling disk – and building the full chain from modelling
          and sensing to algorithms and implementation.

    <!-- HOW I WORK -->
    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>How I Work</h2>
      <article class="project-card">
        <p class="project-summary">
          In my projects, I like to start from the physics and constraints of the real
          system, then design a clean and modular approach: from modelling and simulation
          to experimental validation and data analysis.
        </p>
        <p class="project-summary">
          I pay attention to clear documentation, reproducible code and readable figures,
          whether I am working alone or in a team. I enjoy discussing ideas, challenging
          assumptions and iterating quickly between theory and experiments.

      <article class="project-card">
        <p class="project-summary">
          Outside of my studies, I enjoy activities that keep me curious and active.
          I like exploring new technical topics, learning tools that help me build
          better experiments and systems, and spending time outdoors to disconnect
          from the screen.
